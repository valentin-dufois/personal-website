  "interests.p1": "I have a keen interest in building highly optimized, robust applications using the latest functionalities of C++. I have a profound likeness for code in general, not in building things with code, but in manipulating code itself. I take great pleasure in designing applications architectures and making them future-proof. The other major interest I have is in arts, specifically contemporary art, generative art, and real-time visuals. I work with TouchDesigner to build audio-reactive, dynamic, and colorful visuals taking advantage of the software infinite possibilities and complementing them with my own C++ operators. I work on an {openSourceLib} of components easing the use of TouchDesigner.",
