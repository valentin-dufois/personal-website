I currently work at <a href="https://neo-ooh.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Neo</a> where I conceive and build internal platforms and tools.

After having learn the basis of programmating by myself, I went into studies focused on arts and technology. There, I was able to validate my knowledge, and discover new skills and techniques. I had the chance to work with multiple artists and collectives, allowing me to grow from these new experiences.

As time went by, I worked on project of various sizes and complexities. From the smallest experimental websites to fully-fledge human pose tracking application using multiple sensors, as well as sales tools and tools for TouchDesigner. All these experiences allows me to get a deep understand of the needs of a project, and to better anticipate future possibilities.
