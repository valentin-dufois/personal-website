These past three years working for <a href="https://neo-ooh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer">Neo</a>, I conceived and developed an internal platform tailored to the need of the company.

Neo is a digital advertising company with screens all around Canada. Connect allows easy scheduling of content on the screens, listing inventories in a structure that make sense with the processes of the company, and provide a powerful and efficient sales tool.

Connect allows for granular user management, and is entirely available in both French and English.

Connect is made of multiple modules, each with their specific purpose, but with deep integration with each other.

## Broadcast

Connect's broadcast module was the first section created. Originally, it was conceived as a new version created from scratch of <Link to="/works/neo-traffic">Ad-Direct</Link>; it quickly outgrew this scope.

The broadcast module offers a unified scheduling and monitoring interface for managing broadcasting campaigns, independently of the actual broadcasting system used beneath.<br />
This makes it possible to control a network of heterogeneous screens and system from a single place.

This is made possible thanks to an adapter system. Connect describes campaigns as they exist in a neutral format, which is then used by each adapter to replicate it on its own system. As of now, Connect is able to schedule campaigns on BroadSign, PiSignage and Navori.

Campaigns monitoring is centralized and available in the same interface, making it fast and simple to follow the performances of campaigns.

Campaigns broadcast locations are decided by selecting products, as defined in the inventory.

## Inventory

Neo's inventory structure follows a `property > products` pattern. This structure limits information duplication and gives operators and commercials a structure to browse that resonates with the concepts they use on a daily basis.

As time went by, the quantity of information describing properties and products grew by a lot.<br />
First, properties' traffic, then price handling, tenants directory for malls, then impression calculations, demographic data, pictures, etc.

Our inventory is also available on various digital out of home programmatic providers. This implies that we have to keep our inventory up to date on multiple platforms.<br />
Connect handles all this: by integrating with the other platforms API, updates to our inventory made on Connect are automatically propagated. This system can work both ways, allowing Connect inventory to be based on an external source.<br />
Today, Connect supports synchronizing inventories with Odoo, Hivestack, BroadSign Reach, Atedra and Vistar.

This inventory also provides our salespeople with all the information they need.

## The Planner

Connect's Planner is Neo's sales tool. It helps build precise, detailed broadcast campaigns quickly and efficiently.

The Planner has all the basics: product selection based on categories, provinces and networks, discounts, production costs, etc. But the true strength of the Planner lies in its filters.<br />
Here's some of them:

* **Points of Interest**: Allows placing POIs on the map, either by address, or by name (Time Hortons, banks, etc.) and to limit products selection to those within a certain radius of those places.
* **Polygons**: Allows drawing shapes on the map to limit selection
* **Demographic Filters/Vividata**: Allows filtering properties on demographic indexes; It has more than 5000 variables available.
* **Boundaries**: Uses census geographic data; Allows placing boundaries for cities, forward sortation areas, and electoral districts on the map.
* And others to help filter products by tags, technical specifications, etc.

All these filters can be grouped together to enable additional logic. It is possible to choose if a product needs to pass all filters or only some filters to be included. The effect of a filter can be inverted (e.g.: No products in this polygon.)<br />
Filters results are presented in the list view, describing why a product passed the results.

The campaign performances and prices are automatically recalculated on each change.

The Planner's ease of use and the amount of information it provides, makes it a tool not only used by our salespeople, but by many different peoples in the company, as a way to get insightful information on our network efficiently.

Campaigns created in the planner can also be shared to external peoples through a simplified, read-only interface.

Once a campaign is signed, its performances can be monitored in the contract section.

## Contracts

Contracts monitoring is done every day. It is necessary as ways to ensure that everything is running smoothly.

The Contracts section of Connect centralize all the performances data collected from the broadcast systems. Previously, our operator had to check multiple different platforms interfaces to get all the information. They are now available in a single, unified interface. Campaigns created in Connect as well as those created directly in the Broadcast system can be tracked here.<br />
It is also possible to request screenshots of the currently playing ads to use as proof-of-play. Connect even provides an automated system to mock the screenshots directly onto pictures of the products.

---

As year went bide, Connect rapidly outgrew its original purpose. From a simple scheduling system meant to give autonomy to some of our partners, it became an integral part of all the processes at Neo.<br />

Working all these years on this project, I gained an understanding of the inner workings of Neo's teams, that helped me corner precisely the needs.
I appreciate knowing the work I have done helps many people on their everyday tasks.
