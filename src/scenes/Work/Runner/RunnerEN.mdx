* TouchDesigner base nodes: CHOPs, TOPs, SOPs, etc. to add the to the network. Their description show up when they are selected;
* COMPs from the palette, to add the to the network;
* TOXs from a folder of your choice, to add them to the network;
* Nodes in the network, to navigate to them;
* Multiple actions to organise your nodes (align, distribute, etc.);
* Predefined parameters;
